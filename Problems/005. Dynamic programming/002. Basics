DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

To find a solution to a problem, we divide the problem into sub problems, find
answers to those sub problems, combine them to get the original answer.

eg:
To calculate 1+2+3+4+5
we break it into sub problems: (1+2) + (3+4) + (5)
find the answer to those subproblems: 3 + 7 + 5
combine those answers to get the original answer: 15

//THIS IS THE BASE, REMEMBER THIS : divide the problem, solve the sub problem, combine it to get the final answer

trick:
-> dp[i] usually means the best answer to the problem till the ith index of the array.
-> obviously, final answer will be dp[n] (where n is the size of the array)
-> we cannot directly calculate dp[n], we first need to calculate dp[1], dp[2], ....
   and combine their results to find the value of dp[n].




problem:
we are given an array of integers, and some queries in the format:(1,i) we need to find the sum from 1 to i for each query.

so running a loop for each query [O(N)] and finding sum is a good idea but not very efficient as it takes [O(N*Q)] time.

so lets create a dp array of size n:
where, dp[1]= sum of all numbers from (1,1)
       dp[2]= sum of all numbers from (1,2)
       dp[3]= sum of all numbers from (1,3)
       and so on.

say a[5]={4,5,3,2,1} (1 based indexing)

so, dp[1]=4
    dp[2]=4+5 = 9
    dp[3]=4+5+3=12
    and so on.

    so for index i: dp[i]=a[i]+dp[i-1]

    eg: dp[3] = a[3] + dp[3-1] = a[3] + dp[2] = 3 + 9 = 12


    dp[i]= a[i] + dp[i-1]

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int n = 5; // size of the array
        int[] a = {6, 7, 3, 2, 2};

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1]; // dp array

        int i = 0;
        while (i <= n - 1) {
            if (i == 0)
            {
                dp[i] = a[i];
            }
            else {
                dp[i] = a[i] + dp[i - 1];
            }
            i++;
        }

        int q = 4; // number of queries
        int[] w = {0, 3, 4, 2}; // query array

        i = 0;
        while (i <= q - 1) {
            int query = w[i];
            System.out.println(dp[query]); // O(1) query
            i++;
        }
    }
}

time takes: O(N+Q)
