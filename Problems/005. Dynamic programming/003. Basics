question:

given an array of integers positive and negative, we need to select some elements from this array (select a subset) such that:-
sum of those elements is maximum (sum of the subset is maximum)
no two elements in the subset should be consecutive.

eg: arr={2,4,6,7,8}
answer: 2+6+8=16

common trick: we create a dp array, where dp[i] means the maximum sum we could get till index i of the array.
like: dp[1]=2  (max answer we can get if size of array was 1]
      dp[2]=4  (max answer we can get if size of array was 2]
      dp[3]=8  (max answer we can get if size of array was 3]
      dp[4]=11 (max answer we can get if size of array was 4]
      dp[5]=16 (max answer we can get if size of array was 5]

        now till dp[3] we had pure observation
        on dp[4] if we select a[4]=7 so next number we have to select from 2 element before i.e from a[2] as we cannot select consecutive
        so next could be either number a[1] or a[2] so we would select the max of 2 i.e basically dp[2]

        or if we didn't select a[4] so we will basically get the max answer for dp[4] as dp[3] for sure.

        so for each index we have to find the max subset
        i.e: dp[i]= max(a[i] + dp[i-2] , dp[i-1])

        calc. dp[i] for all "i" from (1 to n) using the above formula
        and dp[n] will give max answer for the whole array.

        if(arr.length>=2){
            dp[2]=Math.max(arr[2],dp[1]);
        }

        for (int i=3;i<arr.length;i++){
            dp[i]=Math.max(arr[i]+dp[i-2],dp[i-1]);
        }

        System.out.println(dp[arr.length-1]);
