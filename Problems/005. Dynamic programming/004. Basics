question: it is the upgraded version of the previous question,
here we are given with 2 arrays, a1 and a2,
we need to select some elements from both the arrays (select subset of elements)
so that the sum of subset is maximum.

if say we selected 5th element from 1 array then we cannot select 5th element of another array as well as
we cannot select immediate previous element of both the array i.e 4th element of both the array.

so by observation we can do for first 2 elements and for 3rd element,
we if we selected 3rd element then we cannot select other array 3rd element and previous element from both array
so our answer will be a[3]+dp[i-2]
if i didnot select 3rd element then answer for dp[3] = dp[2]

for 4th element if i select 4th element then
dp[4]= max from both 4th element of both array + dp[2]

and if i did not select 4th element then
dp[4]= dp[3]
