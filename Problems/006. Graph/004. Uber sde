/*
given a graph with n nodes, m edges; undirected unweighted; each node value is either 0 or 5.
source node is 1.
your task is to find for each node 'i', the shortest path length from node 1 + maximum number of 5 possible in the path.



level is nothing but the shortest path from root to i

               2(5)--3(5)--
   eg:       /              \
            1               5(0)
             \              /
               4(0)--6(5)--



       now there are 2 shortest path from 1 to 5, but we need that shortest path that has maximum number of 5.

       so we will first find the shortest path till node i and then will manage an array which hold count of 5 till that i.
       suppose b[i] tells that if ith node has 5 or not.
       five_count[u] tells number of 5 till node u from 1 via shortest path.



       eg:  suppose we go from 1 to v: and we know the count of 5 from 1 to v and 1 to v is shortest path and
       we go to u from v, and u has not been visited earlier so definitely it will also be the shortest path
       so count of 5 will be count_of_5 till v + 1 (if that u value is also 5 other wise +0)

       and what if we have already visited the u and now we need to check if that new path we are on is
       also the shortest or not and then checking the number of 5 for that also.

       so if(shortest_path[v]+1==shortest_path[u])
       that means we have found another shortest path
       earlier we already knew shortest path from 1-->u
       now 1 more shortest path is there i.e : 1-->v-->u

       so we will check which shortest path from them has max count of 5.

       five_count=max(5_count(u) , 5_count(v)+1)
