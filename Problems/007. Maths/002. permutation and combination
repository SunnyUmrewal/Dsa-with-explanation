nCr =  n
    -------
    n!(n-r)!

nCr : given n distinct things, number of ways to select r things from them
      not consider the internal order of the r things selected.


eg: 4c3 : [1,2,3,4]
so in how many ways we can select 3 numbers from 4, if 4c3: 4!/3! 1! ==> 4
so there are a total of 4 ways it which we can select 3 items from the given 4


i.e: 1,2,3
     1,3,4
     2,3,4
     1,2,4

here if we have selected 1,3,4 then we are not thinking that 4,3,1 or 1,4,3 will also be a selection
so in ncr if we have did 1,3,4 that means we are done with all possible variations of it.

INTERNAL ORDERING DOES NOT MATTER IN nCr.




now if we want to count or select with numbers where internal ordering matters,
then the formula becomes:

nCr * r!

so for the same question if we want to select 3 numbers from the given 4 then
how many ways are there to select then and the internal ordering matters.

eg: [1,2,3,4]
as without ordering we were able to select total or 4 ways i.e:
     1,2,3
     1,3,4
     2,3,4
     1,2,4

with each way we can arrange then in 6 different ways i.e 3!
so the new formula becomes:
4c3 * 3!
i.e: 24


ncr * r! : it is nothing but permutation of r things selected from n things.




question: find the number of arrays of size "n" where each number can be from range 1 to m.

eg: if n=2 m=3

that means in an array we can place 2 numbers that too from 1,2,3

so how many ways we can put number in an array.
11
12
13
21
22
23
31
32
33

total 9 arrays we can make where we can store number from 1 to 3 with array of size 2.
i.e : 3^2 = m^n




ques: find the number of array of size n where each number can be from 1 to m and is strictly increasing.
eg: n=5, m=15

we are not considering the permutation.
so we are choosing 5 distinct numbers from 1 to 15.
and they automatically form exactly 1 strictly increasing array when sorted.

how does 15c5 guarantees strictly increasing?
here 15c5 means choose any distict number from 1 to 15
and order does not matter, the selected number are just in a set not an array yet.

and there is exactly 1 way to make the selected 5 number to be strictly increasing.
no matter in any way we arrange them.

to be strictly increasing: here we cannot repeat number, cannot change order, once chosen order is fixed

we do not take permutation as selecting any 5 number can have total of 5! arrangement and only 1 of them is strictly increasing.

When we do 15C5, we are:
Choosing 5 distinct numbers
NOT arranging them
NOT counting permutations
A combination doesn’t store order
But whenever we need a strictly increasing array,
there is exactly one valid ordering for those chosen numbers.

but in combination we may or may not have selected the right array?
but we always do: a combination is just a set, a set automatically corresponds to its sorted order
and that sorted order is always strictly increasing.

so we are not hoping its increasing, its guaranteed.

so 15c5 is our answer.






topic: STAR AND BAR

given k boxes; find the number of ways to put n balls in them. all n balls are same.

eg: given 2 boxes; find the number of ways to put 5 balls in it.

i.e: 5,0
     4,1
     3,2
     2,3
     1,4
     0,5

total 6 ways; formula is
(n+k-1) C (k-1) => (5+1) C (1) = 6c1 = 6

this means for k boxes and n balls:

k1+k2 == n where k1>=0 k2>=0

now how this formula came:
eg: box 3, ball 5

so imagine we have 7 spaces: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
we put 2 stick on any of the 2 space

_ | _ _ | _ _
and we put balls in the empty spaces
now those sticks represents 3 boxes separation (look carefully)

the 1st box contain 1 ball, 2 box: 2 ball and 3rd box : 2 balls
so we need not arrange the ball we need to find the arrangement of those
2 sticks.

so: total answer for this ques is: 7c2 ; we have 5 balls and 3 boxes so we need 7 spaces so arrange it.
i.e; (n+k-1) C (k-1)


ques: given two linear sequence of size N and M, find the number of ways to generate
a sequence of N+M size; such that order of both the sequence remains the same.

eg: n: 1,2
    m: 3,4

    new array: 1,2,3,4
               1,3,2,4
            these are valid because after 1-->2 is coming and after 3-->4 is coming.

            but 1,4,2,3 this is not valid because; 1 and 2 are in right sequence but 4-->3 are not in right requence

so: eg: n=3, m=5 is given

total arr: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
so suppose we arrange m and in how many ways we can arrange m; 8c5
and the rest we need not to find because the leftover space are for n.

so answer is: (n+m) C (m)
