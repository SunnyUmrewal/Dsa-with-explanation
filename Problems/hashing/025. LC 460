there are 4 LC'S that can be made from here,

then how many L are there before it.

/*
now we need to find the scequence LCT and after doing that
we need to insert a letter from L,C,T at any index and after doing
that we should get max count of lct sequence

so we will try to inset L
so L should be inserted at the starting...
new answer = old_answer + count of “CT” in the string[0……n-1]
as we will get 1 extra sequence for each CT


if we try to insert T
so we should at that at the end of the string
new answer=old answer+ count of lc from 0 to n-1

and if we insert C
then we cannot just insert at the index before the last T
doing that is not optimized for max sequence

instead for each index i we need to insert it at each index
and check if L before that C * T after that C is max?

eg-
String = LLTT
Target = LCT

Insert C before first T:
#L before = 2, #T after = 2 → 4 new subsequences

Insert C before last T:
#L before = 2, #T after = 1 → 2 new subsequences

at last we will check which gives the max count and we return it.
