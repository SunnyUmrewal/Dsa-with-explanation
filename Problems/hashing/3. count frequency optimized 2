/*
final solution: we use hashmap (data structure) having key value pair instead of hash array (index act as key)

it is same as hashing array but it saves space

in hashmap its mainly like a table with 2 vertical sides one is key and one is value
it only has keys that are in the array, is hashing we create hash array for all numbers that are present or not
if array contain - 1,2,10 then we create hash array of size 10+1, (max number +1) , and all other entries are 0
it consumes lots of space.
but now, in hashmap
we only has those keys which are present in array so it saves lots of space


in hashmap, it takes O(n) space, n is size of the array
for an array having- {1,5,15}

hashmap will take O(3) space
hashing will take O(16) space


insertion operation in hashmap has average O(1) time
and printing hashmap[i] also takes O(1) time on average.
